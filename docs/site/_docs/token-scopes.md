title: Token Scopes
---

dtctl's [safety levels](configuration#safety-levels) are a client-side guardrail. The actual access control is determined by the scopes assigned to your Dynatrace platform token. This page documents the recommended scopes for each safety level and resource type.

## Quick Reference

| Safety Level | Use Case | Token Type |
|---|---|---|
| `readonly` | Monitoring, troubleshooting, auditing | Platform token with read scopes |
| `readwrite-mine` | Managing your own workflows and documents | Platform token with read + write scopes |
| `readwrite-all` | Team-wide resource management | Platform token with full write scopes |
| `dangerously-unrestricted` | Admin operations, data/bucket deletion | Platform token with all scopes |

## Scopes by Safety Level
