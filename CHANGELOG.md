## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Agent output envelope (`--agent` / `-A`)** — Wrap all CLI output in a structured JSON envelope (`ok`, `result`, `error`, `context`) for AI agents and automation consumers
  - Auto-detects AI agent environments and enables agent mode automatically (opt out with `--no-agent`)
  - Enriched context (suggestions, pagination, warnings) for `get workflows`, `get workflow-executions`, `delete workflow`, and `apply` commands
  - Structured error output with machine-readable error codes and suggestions
- **`dtctl ctx` command** — Top-level context management shortcut (like kubectx)
  - `dtctl ctx` lists all contexts, `dtctl ctx <name>` switches context
  - Subcommands: `current`, `describe`, `set`, `delete`/`rm`
  - Shared helper functions extracted from `config.go` to eliminate duplication
- **`dtctl doctor` command** — Health check for configuration and connectivity
  - 6 sequential checks: version, config, context, token, connectivity, authentication
  - Token expiration warning (< 24h remaining)
  - Lightweight HEAD request for connectivity probe

### Changed
- **Release signing & SBOM** — Added cosign signing and syft SBOM generation to GoReleaser and release workflow
- **Linter hardening** — Re-enabled `errcheck` and `staticcheck` in golangci-lint v2 config with targeted exclusions (0 issues)
- **CI coverage threshold** — Increased from 49% to 50% as a regression guard
- Refactored `cmd/config.go` to use shared context management helpers (~150 lines of duplication removed)
